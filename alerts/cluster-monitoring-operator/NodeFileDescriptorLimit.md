# NodeFileDescriptorLimit

## Meaning

This alert is triggered when a node's kernel is found to be running out of
available file descriptors -- a `warning` level alert at greater than 70% usage
and a `critical` level alert at greater than 90% usage.

## Impact

Applications on the node may no longer be able to open and operate on
files. This is likely to have severe consequences for anything scheduled on this
node.

## Diagnosis

You can open a shell on the node and use the standard Linux utilities to
diagnose the issue:

```console
$ NODE_NAME='<value of instance label from alert>'

$ oc debug "node/$NODE_NAME"
# sysctl -a | grep 'fs.file-'
fs.file-max = 1597016
fs.file-nr = 7104       0       1597016
# lsof -n
```

## Mitigation

Reduce the number of files opened simultaneously by either adjusting application
configuration or by moving some applications to other nodes.

If the node is a worker node, notify customer to mitigate the issue by sending the following SL
