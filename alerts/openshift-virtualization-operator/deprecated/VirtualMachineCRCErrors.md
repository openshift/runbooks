# VirtualMachineCRCErrors

<!-- This file is deprecated, see VMStorageClassWarning for the relevant and up-to-date runbook content -->

## Meaning

This alert fires when the storage class is incorrectly configured.
A system-wide, shared dummy page causes CRC errors when data is
written and read across different processes or threads.

## Impact

A large number of CRC errors might cause the cluster to display
severe performance degradation.

## Diagnosis

1. Navigate to **Observe** -> **Metrics** in the web console.

2. Obtain a list of virtual machines with incorrectly configured storage classes
   by running the following PromQL query:
   ```text
   kubevirt_ssp_vm_rbd_volume{rxbounce_enabled="false", volume_mode="Block"} == 1
   ```

   The output displays a list of virtual machines that use a storage
   class without `rxbounce_enabled`.

   Example output:
   ```text
   kubevirt_ssp_vm_rbd_volume{name="testvmi-gwgdqp22k7", namespace="test_ns", pv_name="testvmi-gwgdqp22k7", rxbounce_enabled="false", volume_mode="Block"} 1
   ```

3. Obtain the storage class name by running the following command:

   ```bash
   $ oc get pv <pv_name> -o=jsonpath='{.spec.storageClassName}'
   ```

## Mitigation

Add the `krbd:rxbounce` map option to the storage class configuration to use
a bounce buffer when receiving data:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: vm-sc
parameters:
  # ...
  mounter: rbd
  mapOptions: "krbd:rxbounce"
provisioner: openshift-storage.rbd.csi.ceph.com
# ...
```

The `krbd:rxbounce` option creates a bounce buffer to receive data. The default
behavior is for the destination buffer to receive data directly. A bounce buffer
is required if the stability of the destination buffer cannot be guaranteed.
