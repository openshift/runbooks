# VirtControllerRESTErrorsHigh [Deprecated]

This alert is deprecated. You can safely ignore or silence it.
st 60 minutes.

This is most likely because `virt-controller` has partially lost connection to
the API server.

This error is frequently caused by one of the following problems:

- The API server is overloaded, which causes timeouts. To verify if this is the
case, check the metrics of the API server, and view its response times and
overall calls.

- The `virt-controller` pod cannot reach the API server. This is commonly caused
by DNS issues on the node and networking connectivity issues.

## Impact

Node-related actions, such as starting and migrating, and scheduling virtual
machines, are delayed. Running workloads are not affected, but reporting their
current status might be delayed.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
   ```

2. List the available `virt-controller` pods:

   ```bash
   $ oc get pods -n $NAMESPACE -l=kubevirt.io=virt-controller
   ```

3. Check the `virt-controller` logs for error messages when connecting to the
API server:

   ```bash
   $ oc logs -n $NAMESPACE <virt-controller>
   ```

## Mitigation

- If the `virt-controller` pod cannot connect to the API server, delete the pod
to force a restart:

  ```bash
  $ oc delete -n $NAMESPACE <virt-controller>
  ```
